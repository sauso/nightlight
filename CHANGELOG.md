# Changelog

All notable changes to Nightlight (server + web app) are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). While on 0.x: minor bumps for new
features, patch bumps for fixes. History before 0.1.0 exists only as git history —
0.1.0 is the first tracked release, not the first release.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- **Pull-to-refresh** on the camera dashboard: pull down to rebuild every camera's stream
  connection without restarting the app. This is the fix for a camera that shows
  disconnected on one device and won't come back on its own - a WebRTC connection that's
  wedged "connected" but no longer delivering frames. Crucially it works inside the native
  mobile apps too, where the browser's own pull-to-refresh gesture doesn't exist (so the
  previous "just pull to refresh" advice couldn't actually be followed there). The
  browser's native page-reload pull is suppressed so it can't fire underneath it.

### Changed
- Troubleshooting docs, the Camera history panel, and `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` now point to
  pull-to-refresh (which works everywhere) rather than "close and reopen the app".

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- **Camera history** panel in Settings (admin): a persistent, at-a-glance log of camera
  drop-outs, recoveries, and transcoder restarts, so "was that the camera, the server, or
  just my phone?" can be answered from the app instead of by reading `docker logs`. A real
  outage shows up here (every device saw it); a camera stuck on only one phone with nothing
  in the history is that phone's WebRTC connection - reopen the app. Kept for up to 30 days
  and hard-capped so it can't grow the data volume unbounded.
- `KNOWN-ISSUES.md`, a catalogue of understood quirks (camera-firmware glitches, the
  wedged-WebRTC-on-one-device case, the 30s watchdog recovery window, DTS log noise) with
  what each means and whether it needs any action. Linked from the README's Troubleshooting
  section, which also gained a note about the reopen-the-app fix for a stuck camera tile.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- The "Add to Home Screen" install banner no longer appears inside the native
  mobile app (it's only meaningful in a browser; the native WebView doesn't
  report standalone display mode, so it was slipping through).

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- The About page's mobile-app GitHub link now points to `sauso/nightlight-mobile`
  (the companion repo was renamed from `nightlight-android` ahead of iOS support).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-24

### Security
- Upgraded react-router 6 → 7, clearing a moderate advisory (GHSA-337j-9hxr-rhxg,
  an SSR-only issue that this client-only SPA was never exposed to). No API
  changes were needed - the app uses only React Router's library-mode surface,
  which is unchanged in v7.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- A camera glitch could leave two FFmpeg processes fighting over the same
  MediaMTX path indefinitely - MediaMTX lets a new publisher override the
  current one, so each process kicked the other off and restarted, flapping the
  stream every ~10 seconds (observed: 901 restarts over 2.5 hours overnight).
  A crashed process now only restarts itself if it still owns the camera, and
  re-checks ownership when its 5-second restart timer fires.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- "Not a safety device" notice in the README and on the About page: Nightlight is
  not a medical device and never a substitute for adult supervision.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- MQTT can now be switched off in Settings without losing the saved broker
  config - previously the only "off" was clearing the host, and a temporarily
  stopped broker meant endless reconnect attempts in the logs.
- Text filter on the log viewer (case-insensitive, with a match count) - much
  easier to find specific events on a phone.
- About page in the menu: app version, GitHub / changelog / issue links, and a
  way to support the project.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- "Change server" menu item in the hamburger menu, shown only inside the Android app —
  clears the saved server address and returns the native shell to its setup screen
  (pairs with nightlight-android 0.1.0).

### Fixed
- White bar below the bottom navigation on iOS, revealed by Safari's elastic
  overscroll (the page background now extends behind the document).
- Gray placeholder play icon showing on camera tiles before a stream connects in the
  Android app (the WebView's default poster-less video affordance; suppressed with a
  blank poster).
- Returning to the Android app after long background listening no longer forces a full
  reload — the reload-on-return recovery is skipped when the native foreground service
  was holding the connection alive the whole time, so the stream continues unbroken.

### Security
- Camera edit/delete now require the admin role (previously any caregiver could
  repoint a camera's RTSP URL or delete cameras); the RTSP URL, which usually embeds
  the camera's own credentials, is no longer returned to non-admin accounts.
- Changing a password (self-service or admin reset) now signs out the user's other
  devices instead of leaving those sessions valid for up to 30 days.
- Failed logins take constant time whether or not the username exists, so response
  timing no longer confirms valid usernames.
- Express now runs in production mode in the image — error responses no longer include
  stack traces revealing server file paths.
- Correct client IPs behind the reverse proxy (`trust proxy` set to loopback), making
  the login rate limiter count attempts per real client instead of per proxy.
- Sessions idle past the token's own 30-day lifetime are purged daily.
- Docker builds install from committed lockfiles (`npm ci`) for a reproducible,
  auditable dependency tree; vite upgraded 5 → 8 (clears dev-server advisories); both
  packages audit clean.
